**Summary: The Darwin GÃ¶del Machine â€“ AI That Evolves Itself**  

This edition of *The Sequence* explores the **Darwin GÃ¶del Machine (DGM)**, a groundbreaking AI framework that merges **self-modifying code (GÃ¶del Machine theory) with evolutionary search**. DGM autonomously improves its own Python code by:  
- **Generating and testing code patches** on benchmarks like SWE-bench and Polyglot.  
- **Archiving high-performing variants** to enable continuous, open-ended advancement.  

Why it matters: DGM pioneers a **scalable, empirical approach to self-improving AI**, bridging theory and real-world application. A must-read for those tracking AI autonomy and meta-learning.
